1. Business Understanding:
This phase focuses on understanding the project objectives from a business perspective and converting this knowledge into a data analytics problem definition. Stakeholder interviews, business objectives, and other domain knowledge are crucial in this phase.

Key Tasks:

Identify business objectives.
Assess the current situation.
Determine data mining goals.
Produce a project plan.

2. Data Understanding:
In this phase, you collect the data, familiarize yourself with it, and identify data quality problems. This includes the initial data collection as well as the activities to get familiar with the data, identify data quality problems, and first insights into the data.

Key Tasks:

Collect initial data.
Describe data.
Explore data.
Verify data quality.

3. Data Preparation:
This phase involves the actual preparation steps such as cleaning, transforming, and enriching data. Multiple cycles of data preparation and modeling may occur.

Key Tasks:

Data cleaning (handling missing values, removing outliers, etc.).
Data transformation (normalization, encoding categorical variables, etc.).
Feature engineering and selection.

4. Modeling:
During this phase, you'll select the modeling technique, generate test design, build the model, and assess the model. This phase often involves running multiple algorithms and techniques to find the best-performing one.

Key Tasks:

Select modeling technique.
Generate test design.
Build the model.
Assess the model.

5. Evaluation:
The model is evaluated in the context of the business objectives established during the first phase. This phase determines if the model meets the objectives and requirements effectively.

Key Tasks:

Evaluate results.
Review the process.
Determine next steps.

6. Deployment:
The focus of this phase is to deploy the model into a production setting where it can provide practical value. Deployment could be as simple as generating a report or as complex as implementing the model into a live system.

Key Tasks:

Plan deployment.
Plan monitoring and maintenance.
Produce a final report.
Review the project.
